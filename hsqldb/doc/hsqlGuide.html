<h2>RUNNING HSQLDB COMPONENTS AND TOOLS</h2>
<p>The HSQLDB jar package consists of several programs: </p>
<p>HSQLDB RDBMS</p>
<p>HSQLDB JDBC Driver</p>
<p>Database Manager (Swing and AWT versions)</p>
<p>Transfer Tool (Swing and AWT versions)</p>
<p>Query Tool (AWT)</p>
<p>Script Tool</p>
<p>The HSQLDB RDBMS and JDBC Driver provide the core functionality. The rest are 
  general-purpose database tools that can be used with any database engine that 
  has a JDBC driver.</p>
<h3>RUNNING TOOLS</h3>
<p>All tools can be run in the standard way for archived Java classes. In the 
  following example the AWT version of the Database Manager, the hsqldb.jar is 
  located in the directory ../lib relative to the current directory.</p>
<pre>java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>If hsqldb.jar is in the current directory, the command would change to:</p>
<pre>java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager</pre>
<p>The list of main classes for the tools are follows:</p>
<pre>org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager
org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing
org.hsqldb.util.Transfer
org.hsqldb.util.TransferSwing
org.hsqldb.util.QueryTool
org.hsqldb.util.ScriptTool</pre>
<p>Some tools, such as the Database Manager or Script Tool, can use command line 
  arguments or entirely rely on them. You can add the command line argument -? 
  to get a list of available arguments for these tools. Database Manager and Transfer 
  Tool feature a graphical user interface and can be explored interactively.</p>
<h3>RUNNING HSQLDB</h3>
<p>HSQLDB can be run in a number of different ways. In general these are divided 
  into Server Modes and In-Process Mode (also called Standalone Mode). A different 
  sub-program from the jar is used to run HSQLDB in each mode.</p>
<p>Each HSQLDB database consists of between 2 to 4 files, all named the same but 
  with different extensions, located in the same directory. For example, the database 
  named "test" consists of the following files:</p>
<pre>test.properties<br>test.script<br>test.data<br>test.backup</pre>
<p>The properties files contains general settings about the database. The script 
  file contains the definition of tables and other database objects, plus the 
  data for non-cached tables. The data file contains the data for cached tables 
  and the backup file is a zipped backup of the last known consistent state of 
  the cache. All these files are essential and should never be deleted. If the 
  database has no cached tables, the <code>test.data</code> and <code>test.backup</code> 
  files will not be present. In addition to those files, HSQLDB database may link 
  to any formatted text files, such as CSV lists, anywhere on the disk. <em>When 
  the engine closes the database at a shutdown, it creates temporary files with 
  the extension</em><code> .new </code><em>which it then renames to those listed 
  above.</em></p>
<h3>SERVER MODES</h3>
<p>Server modes provide the maximum accessibility. The database engine runs in 
  a JVM and listens for connections from programs on the same computer or other 
  computers on the network. Several different programs can connect to the server 
  and retrieve or update information. Applications programs (clients) connect 
  to the server using the HSQLDB JDBC driver. In all server modes, the server 
  serves only one database that is specified at the time of running the server. 
  If you need to provide connectivity to several databases, you should run several 
  instances of the server each on a different port.</p>
<p>Server modes can use preset properties or command line arguments detailed in <a href="hsqlAdvancedGuide.html">hsqlAdvancedGuide.html</a>. There are three server modes, based on the protocol used for communications 
  between the client and server.</p>
<h4>HSQLDB Server</h4>
<p>This is the preferred way of running a database server and the fastest one. 
  A proprietary communications protocol is used for this mode. A command similar 
  to those used for running tools and described above is used for running the 
  server. An example of the command for starting the server is:</p>
<pre>java -cp ../bin/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database mydb</pre>
<p>The command line argument <code>-?</code> can be used to get a list of available 
  arguments.</p>
<h4>HSQLDB Web Server</h4>
<p>This mode is used when access to the computer hosting the database server is restricted 
  to the HTTP protocol. The only reason for using the Web Server mode is restrictions imposed by firewalls on the client or server machines and it should not be used where there are no such restrictions.  The HSQLDB Web Server is a special web server that allows 
  JDBC clients to connect via HTTP. As the HTTP protocol is stateless, connections 
  to a web server do not have a persistent session. This limits the range of actions 
  that can be performed on the database. Each time you issue a JDBC command, it 
  is treated as a new connection to the database. As a result transactions cannot 
  be rolled back.</p>
<p>To run  a web server, replace the  main class for the server in the example command line above with the following:</p>
<pre>org.hsqldb.WebServer</pre>
<p>The command line argument -? can be used to get a list of available arguments.</p>
<h4>HSQLDB Servlet</h4>
<p>This uses the same protocol as the Web Server and has the same limitations. 
  It is used when a separate servlet engine (or application server) such as Tomcat 
  or Resin provides access to the database. The Servlet Mode cannot be started 
  independently from the servlet engine. The <code>hsqlServlet</code> class, in 
  the HSQLDB jar, should be installed on the application server to provide the 
  connection. The database is specified using an application server property. 
  Refer to the source file <code>hsqlServlet.java</code> to see the details.</p>
<p>Both Web Server and Servlet modes can only be accessed using the JDBC driver 
  at the client end. They do not provide a web front end to the database.</p>
<h4>Connecting to a Databases Running as Server</h4>
<p>Once an HSQLDB server is running, client programs can connect to it using the 
  HSQLDB JDBC Driver contained in <code>hsqldb.jar</code>. Full information on 
  how to connect to a server is provided in the Java Documentation for <a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcConnection.html"><code>jdbcConnection</code></a> 
  (located in the <code>/doc/src</code> directory of HSQLDB distribution. A common 
  example is connection to the default port (9001) used for the hsql protocol 
  on the same machine:</p>
<pre>try {
    Class.<b>forName</b> ( "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver" );
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("ERROR: failed to load HSQLDB JDBC driver.");
    e.printStackTrace();
    return;
}

Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>Note in the above connection URL, there is no mention of the database (file) 
  as this was specified when running the server.</p>
<h3>IN-PROCESS (Standalone) MODE</h3>
<p>This mode runs the database engine as part of your application program in the 
  same Java Virtual Machine. For some applications this mode can be faster, as 
  the data is not converted and sent over the network. The main drawback is that 
  it is not possible to connect to the database from outside your application. 
  As a result you cannot check the contents of the database with external tools 
  such as Database Manager while your application is running. The recommended 
  way of using this mode in an application is to use an HSQLDB Server instance 
  for the database while developing the application and then switch to In-Process 
  mode for deployment.</p>
<p>An In-Process Mode database is started from JDBC, with the database file path 
  specified in the connection URL. For example, if the database name is testdb 
  and its files are located in the same directory as where the command to run 
  your application was issued, the following code is used for the connection:</p>
<pre>Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:testdb", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>The database file path format can be specified using forward slashes in Windows 
  hosts as well as Linux hosts. So relative paths or paths that refer to the same 
  directory on the same drive can be identical. For example if your database path 
  in Linux is <code>/opt/db/testdb</code> and you create an identical directory 
  structure on the <code>C:</code> drive of a Windows host, you can use the same 
  URL in both Windows and Linux:</p>
<pre>Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:/opt/db/testdb", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>Refer to Javadoc for <a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcConnection.html"><code>jdbcConnection</code></a> for more details.</p>
<h4>Memory Only Databases</h4>
<p>It is possible to run HSQLDB in a way that the database is not persistent and 
  exists entirely in random access memory. As no information is written to disk, 
  this mode should be used only for internal processing of application data, in 
  applets or certain special applications. This mode is specified by using a dot 
  "." as the database file path.</p>
<pre>Connection c = DriverManager.<b>getConnection</b> ("jdbc:hsqldb:.", "sa", ""); </pre>
<p>You can also run a memory only server instance by specifying a dot as the name 
  of the database. This usage is not common and is limited to special applications where the database server is used only for exchanging information between clients.</p>
 
<h4>Closing the Database</h4>
<p>All databases running in different modes can be closed with the SHUTDOWN command, 
  issued as an SQL query. In-process databases are closed also when the last connection 
  to the database is explicitly closed via JDBC. When SHUTDOWN is issued, all 
  active transactions are rolled back. A special form of closing the database 
  is via the SHUTDOWN COMPACT command. This command rewrites the <code>.data</code> 
  file that contains the information stored in CACHED tables and compacts it to 
  size. This command should be issued periodically, especially when lots of inserts, 
  updates or deletes are performed on the cached tables. Changes to the structure 
  of the database, such as dropping or modifying tables or indexes also create 
  large amounts of unused space that can be reclaimed using this command.</p>
<h3>USING THE DATABASE ENGINE</h3>
<p>Once a connection is established to a database in any mode, JDBC methods are 
  used to interact with the database. The Javadoc for <code><a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcConnection.html">jdbcConnection</a></code>, 
  <code><a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcDriver.html">jdbcDriver</a></code>, <code><a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcDatabaseMetaData.html">jdbcDatabaseMetadata</a></code>, <code><a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcResultSet.html">jdbcResultSet</a></code>, 
  <code><a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcStatement.html">jdbcStatement</a></code> and <code><a href="src/org/hsqldb/jdbcPreparedStatement.html">jdbcPreparedStatement</a></code> list all the 
  supported JDBC methods together with information that is specific to HSQLDB. 
  JDBC methods are broadly divided into: connection related methods, metadata 
  methods and database access methods. The database access methods use SQL commands 
  to perform actions on the database and return the results either as a Java primitive 
  type or as an instance of the <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code> class.</p>
<p>You can use Database Manager or other Java database access tools to explore 
  your database and update it with SQL commands. These programs use JDBC internally 
  to submit your commands to the database engine and to display the results in 
  a human readable format.</p>
<p>The SQL dialect used in HSQLDB is as close to the SQL92 standard as it has 
  been possible to achieve so far in a small footprint database engine. The full 
  list of SQL commands is in <a href="hsqlSyntax.html">hsqlSyntax.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Different Types of Table</h4>
<p>HSQLDB supports TEMP tables and three types of persistent tables.</p>
<p>TEMP tables are not written to disk and last only for the lifetime of the Connection 
  object. Each TEMP table is visible only from the Connection that was used to 
  create it; other concurrent connections to the database will not have access 
  to the table.</p>
<p>The three types of persistent tables are MEMORY tables, CACHED tables and TEXT 
  tables.</p>
<p>Memory tables are the default type when the CREATE TABLE command is used. Their 
  data is held entirely in memory but any change to their structure or contents 
  is written to the <code>&lt;dbname&gt;.script</code> file. The script file is 
  read the next time the database is opened, and the MEMORY tables are recreated 
  with all their contents.</p>
<p>CACHED tables are created with the CREATE CACHED TABLE command. Only part of 
  their data is held in memory, allowing large tables that would otherwise take 
  up to several hundred megabytes of memory. Another advantage of cached tables 
  is that the database engine takes less time to start up when a cached table 
  is used for large amounts of data. The disadvantage of cached tables is a reduction 
  in speed. Do not use cached tables if your data set is relatively small.</p>
<p>TEXT tables are new to version 1.7.0 and use a CSV (Comma Separated Value) 
  or other delimited text file as the source of their data. You can specify an 
  existing CSV file, such as a dump from another database or program, as the source 
  of a TEXT table. Alternatively, you can specify an empty file to be filled with 
  data by the database engine. TEXT tables are efficient in memory usage and faster 
  than CACHED tables. Two commands are needed to set up a TEXT table as detailed 
  in <a href="hsqlTextTables.html">hsqlTextTables.html</a> document.</p>
<h4>CONSTRAINTS and INDEXES</h4>
<p>HSQLDB supports PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY constraints. 
  In addition, it supports UNIQUE or ordinary indexes. This support is fairly 
  comprehensive and covers multi-column constraints and indexes, plus cascading 
  deletes for foreign keys.</p>
<p>HSQLDB creates indexes internally to support PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE and FOREIGN 
  KEY constraints: a unique index is created for each PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint; 
  an ordinary index is created for each FOREIGN KEY constraint. Because of this, 
  you should not create duplicate user-defined indexes on the same column sets 
  covered by these constraints. This would result in unnecessary memory and speed 
  overheads. See the discussion in <a href="hsqlAdvancedGuide.html">hsqlAdvancedGuide.html</a>  for more information.</p>

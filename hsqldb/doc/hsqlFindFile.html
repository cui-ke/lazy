<h3>hsqldb version 1.7.0 Find File sample application</h3>
<p>This application builds a database of a directory tree and allows you to search 
  the database.</p>
<p>This example application is designed for programmers who are new to the JDBC. 
  The functionality is kept low, so it should be easy to understand what is going 
  on. It connects, execute queries and inserts data into the database. </p>
<p>First, the database must be initialized with a path. All the file names in 
  this directory and all its subdirectories will be stored in the database. After 
  this is done, the database can be searched for files that match a specific pattern. 
</p>
<p>This sample application is not compiled as part of the hsqldb jar. You should 
  compile it yourself. You should modify the following examples to include the 
  correct location of the hsqldb.jar in the commands. </p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>Re-create database from directory '.': </p>
<p><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>java -classpath 
  %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.sample.FindFile -init .</span></code> </p>
<p>for convenience there is also a batch file that does the same: </p>
<p><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>run FindFile 
  -init .</span></code> </p>
<p>Find files like 'name': </p>
<p><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>java -classpath 
  %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.sample.FindFile name</span></code> </p>
